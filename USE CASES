Title: Determine License and Vulnerability Information
Primary Actor: Manager
Goal in Context: The manager is able to determine license and vulnerability information from provided software license and vulnerability
database
Stakeholders:
        Manager: To receive clear and relevant license and vulnerability information
        Developer: To provide the relevant file/package level information
        Project Owner: To clearly understand corporate manager decisions to green/red light a project
Preconditions:
        Relevant file/package information is in the software license and vulnerability database
        Proper project information has been provided
Main Success Scenario: Manager receives accurate license and vulnerability information for the requested project packages
Failed End Conditions: Corporate manager receives inaccurate or invalid license and vulnerability information for the requested project 
packages
Trigger: Corporate manager uploads or identifies project information to which license and vulnerability information is provided

COMMENT: My only concern here is that you are splitting one dataflow (request for license and vulnerability information) into two 
use cases. But with four use cases, you are covered here.
