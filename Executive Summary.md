#Executive Summary

####Motivation
For assignment 1, I designed a system to do two key things: work with software package vulnerabilities and licenses, 
and handle corporate policy updates.  The system aims to make developers and managers in the company aware of potential 
vulnerabilities and licenses held in incoming software packages and allow managers to create new policies or update current 
policies to prevent damage to the company.  Open source software can have one or many licenses associated with it, restricting
its use and distribution.  Violating any of these licenses can cause a number of problems, like product recalls and lawsuits.
In addition to the licenses, vulnerabilities can have much the same effect.  If there is a problem with the software,
such as a security hole, this can cause incorrect data, or even leave the company and its customers as potential victims
to hackers.
